# The minimalist Dojo timer #
A fully functional timer to be used in Dojos, aiming simplicity and minimalism, while keeping flexibility and robustness.

## Dojo anywhere ##
Front-end based, built on JS and HTML to ensure accessibility even if little or no bandwidth at all available. Plug and Play!

## Built for hardcore ##
The founding JS code was written in 10 minutes while standing in the rain waiting for the bar crew to open the place. There we held the first Design Dojo that we know about, applying the Dojo and Coding Dojo principles, concepts and practices to the AI/Graphic design world.
